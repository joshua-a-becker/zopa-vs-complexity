**Party A Role Materials:**  
You’re going on a vacation with two friends and need to agree on some trip details. You’re adventurous but on a tight budget, so you want to stay active without spending much. At the same time, you prefer a relaxed schedule, since a good vacation for you means getting the most value with minimal stress and plenty of adventure. You also know your friends differ: some may not care about saving money and may want to travel at a faster pace. You might need to make compromises to find a plan everyone enjoys.

Below are your preferences for each possible vacation detail. Higher points mean greater satisfaction. If your total score is above zero, then it’s a plan you prefer to the option of staying home. If your score is below zero, you’d rather not go on the vacation at all.  All three of you must agree to the vacation, or you're all staying home. The total points you earn correspond directly to your bonus on Prolific.
