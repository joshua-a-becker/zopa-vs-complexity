# **Shared Space Negotiation: Food Bank**

## GENERAL INFORMATION

The Citizens' Resource Hub and the Community Harvest food bank were connected by a shared stakeholder when it became clear both were seeking to open branches in the same area. Because you have relatively compatible needs and serve overlapping populations, you stand to save considerable resources and support each other by sharing space. After spending time exploring the broad topic and lining up a list of possible shared venues, both sides agree that a viable partnership is very desirable—in this increasingly uncertain and cash-strapped world, there's not much room for waste.

The exact renovation and usage details don't need to be worked out right now, but the goal is to hammer out a broad plan covering a few key areas.

## YOUR ROLE: Food Bank

**Your Mission:** You're expanding your regional food distribution network into this area. Your organization collects donated food, organizes it, and distributes it to families and individuals facing food insecurity. This new location will serve as both a distribution point where clients pick up groceries and a volunteer hub where your team sorts donations and manages logistics.

**Your Funding Reality:** As a mostly volunteer-run organization, you don't have the staff payroll costs that other nonprofits face. That makes rent and maintenance your largest budget items—every dollar of rent matters significantly to your bottom line. You're reallocating resources from your central budget to make this expansion happen, and you need to keep both up-front and ongoing costs as low as possible.

**Your Space Needs:** Day-to-day operations don't require much space—you need one dedicated private office for administrative work and client meetings. However, you also need flex space that you can expand into when volunteers are receiving donations, organizing stock, and managing logistics. These sessions often involve new volunteer orientation and training, and the work tends to spread out and take over available space. More storage space is always better, and ideally you'd have delivery bay access too.

**Your Strategic Concerns:** You're very flexible on the physical space configuration since volunteers can adapt to various setups, which means your share of renovation costs will be relatively low. However, you still face a substantial upfront conversion cost, so you prefer a longer lease to make sure it's worth the setup investment. But even if you get a shorter lease, you expect CAB will decide to stick around long term. And if they don't, chances are good you could find another compatible organization to share the space.

**The Weekend Question:** One key concern for you is weekend access. Saturdays are when most of your volunteers are available, and you can handle a week's worth of logistics without getting in the way of clients picking up groceries. Some food banks do manage to do everything on weekdays, especially if they have a larger space, but it's not ideal.

**What You Really Want:** The ideal scenario is a bigger space with delivery bay access that gives you room for logistics operations. Like CAB, you prefer a downtown location, but space and affordability are even bigger concerns. 

**Your Priorities:**

- **Location:** Bigger space for logistics and storage, plus delivery bay access if possible.  Space and affordability matter most.  
- **Renovation Costs:** Since you're flexible on space configuration, your renovation needs are modest. Usually, you do very little to adapt spaces for new locations.  You'd prefer CAB to shoulder more of the renovation costs since they have more specific requirements.  
- **Rent Split:** This is your largest ongoing expense, so every percentage point matters. Since CAB has more specific needs and you're flexible, you'd prefer they pay a bit more of the rent.  
- **Lease Term:** You need stability to justify your upfront investment and establish reliable community operations. You prefer longer terms like 7-10 years.  
- **Evening/Weekend Access:** This is critical for volunteer coordination. Weekend-only access for FB would be ideal, shared access is workable, closed is problematic.  
- **Space Allocation:** More storage/flex space would be helpful for logistics operations, but it's not critical since you have off-site options. You can work with various configurations.
