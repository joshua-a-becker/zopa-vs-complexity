# **SharedSpace Negotiation: Citizens' Resource Hub**

## GENERAL INFORMATION

The Citizens' Resource Hub and the Community Harvest food bank were connected by a shared stakeholder when it became clear both were seeking to open branches in the same area. Because you have relatively compatible needs and serve overlapping populations, you stand to save considerable resources and support each other by sharing space. After spending time exploring the broad topic and lining up a list of possible shared venues, both sides agree that a viable partnership is very desirable—in this increasingly uncertain and cash-strapped world, there's not much room for waste.

The exact renovation and usage details don't need to be worked out right now, but the goal is to hammer out a broad plan covering a few key areas.

## YOUR ROLE: Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB)

**Your Mission:** You're opening a new branch of a national network to serve this community. Your work involves helping people navigate complex benefits, housing, debt, and legal issues—all requiring confidential one-on-one consultations with trained advisors.

**Your Funding Reality:** Like most advice services, your largest budget item is professional staff salaries—rent is important, but it's a smaller percentage of your overall costs. Here's where things get interesting: your branch is responsible for all ongoing costs, but a substantial portion of upfront renovation costs is covered by an anonymous donor who grew up in the area and "learned all this stuff the hard way." This donor wants to give back, but they're funding the setup, not the long-term operations.

**Your Space Needs:** You need at least 2 private offices for confidential client meetings—these are non-negotiable for your work. Ideally, you'd have 3 dedicated private offices, but you could make do with 2 private offices plus 2 hot desks shared with the Food Bank if needed. The rest of your staff can work in an open floor plan. You don't need much storage—mostly just filing cabinets for case records.

**Your Strategic Concerns:** Because the donor covers upfront costs but you're on the hook for ongoing expenses, you're more sensitive to long-term commitments than renovation costs. You want to avoid getting locked into a lengthy lease if the branch doesn't take off. You also want to minimize recurring costs like evening/weekend staffing—your services are typically needed during business hours, and for special events, clients can travel to other branches in the network. That said, if the space is going to be open evenings/weekends anyway, you'd want access for occasional workshops or staff overtime.

**What You Really Want:** The ideal scenario is a larger space that gives you room to grow as the branch establishes itself. While a downtown location would be more professional and convenient for clients, you're pragmatic—cost savings and space matter more than prestige. A bigger peripheral location that's affordable beats a cramped expensive office downtown.

**Your Priorities:**

- **Location:** Bigger space for future growth is the priority—even if it means being peripheral rather than downtown. Space and affordability beat central location.  
- **Renovation Costs:** You have donor funding for a substantial portion, so while you prefer to pay less, you have some flexibility here. Money is still money, even with donor support.  
- **Rent Split:** You operate on a lean budget, and unlike renovation (one-time), rent is forever. You prefer to pay less, though it's not your biggest concern since staff salaries dwarf rent costs.  
- **Lease Term:** Flexibility is key—you want shorter terms so you're not trapped if the branch struggles. You strongly prefer 3-5 years maximum.  
- **Evening/Weekend Access:** You prefer the space closed to save on insurance and facilities costs. If it's open, you want occasional access.  
- **Space Allocation:** You need office space for private consultations. Storage needs are minimal—you prefer 60% office minimum.
